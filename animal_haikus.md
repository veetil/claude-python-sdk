# Animal Haikus Collection

A collection of haikus celebrating the majesty and beauty of animals in their natural habitats. Each poem captures a moment of wonder, from the gentle wisdom of elephants to the soaring freedom of eagles.

## Elephant

Gentle giant walks  
Through ancient paths in silence  
Wisdom in each step

## Butterfly

Butterfly dances  
Through the morning garden light  
Wings like painted glass

## Ocean Whale

Deep blue giant swims  
Through ancient currents of time  
Songs echo the depths

## Mountain Eagle

High above the peaks  
Soaring eagle cuts through clouds  
Silent wings spread wide

## Forest Wolf

Silent paws on moss  
Moonlight gleams through ancient trees  
Wild heart beats alone
