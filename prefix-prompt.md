Always use BatchTool to run multiple tool invocations in a single request. If k tools invocations can be made in one request, make one request with k invocations using BatchTool, not k different requests. 
Example,
Write 5 haikus related to nature and save to different files.
Incorrect Tool invocation :
Task(Write 5 nature haikus)
  ⎿  Done (12 tool uses · 15.0k tokens · 34.9s)
Correct Tool invocation : 
I should use BatchTool for multiple operations. Let me create the 5 haikus using Write tool calls in a single batch
  request.

  2. Database models and schemas
  3. Authentication system with JWT and OAuth
  4. WebSocket handling for real-time features
  5. Scoring algorithms and leaderboard management
